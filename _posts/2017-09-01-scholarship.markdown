No, we don't have Hamilton tickets. We've got something better! Tickets to DevFest Florida! 😄

We want to make sure that we are serving __**ALL**__ the folks of Tampa, St. Pete, Orlando, Melbourne as well as other areas across the state. That's why we set aside some tickets for members of underrepresented groups, which includes, but is not limited to: women, people of color, LGBTQ people, disabled people, and those facing economic hardships.

Please check out the form below. Tell us about yourself. Tell us what you're working on, why you're interested in attending, what you hope to get out of DevFest Florida, etc. We'll be accepting applications until **September 22nd 2017**. Those selected will be notified on **October 1st 2017**.

**[Apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdj9esT7LDjFZcukwAvKA6gYFHErFbBH2LY3vIPLElhL-2q9g/viewform)**

We're also accepting donations to the Inclusivity Scholarship fund via our [eventbrite page](https://devfestflorida.eventbrite.com). We're asking for minimum donations of $80 to help cover the bulk of the cost of a ticket. Yes, you can donate less, however we'll be recognizing those that donate the requested amount at the conference.

If your company believes technology should be promoted equally across all groups and would like to help sponsor this initiative, please reach out to us. Our email is organizers@devfestflorida.org

We greatly appreciate everyone’s support.
